 convert Markdown (mermaid / mmd) to Visio (vsdx)

AI-assisted programming simplifies the creation of algorithm flowcharts. Many large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating Markdown (Mermaid) flowcharts. However, Markdown editors lack the functionality to edit these flowcharts as intuitively as specialized drawing tools such as Visio, which allow for actions like moving nodes or reorganizing layouts.

The tool md2visio bridges this gap by converting Markdown (Mermaid/MMD) into Visio (.vsdx) format. This enables users to leverage the capabilities of LLMs for initial chart creation while also benefiting from the advanced editing features of Visio for further customization and refinement of the flowcharts.
